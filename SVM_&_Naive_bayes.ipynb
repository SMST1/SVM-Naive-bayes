        "*1.What is a Support Vector Machine (SVM)?*\n",
        "\n",
        "A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used primarily for classification tasks, though it can also be used for regression. Its main goal is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Concepts:\n",
        "Hyperplane: A decision boundary that separates classes. In 2D, it's a line; in 3D, a plane; and in higher dimensions, it's called a hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "Support Vectors: The data points that are closest to the hyperplane. These points are critical because they define the position and orientation of the hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "Margin: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class. SVM aims to maximize this margin for better generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear vs Non-linear SVM:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear SVM: Works well when data is linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Non-linear SVM: Uses kernel functions (like RBF, polynomial, sigmoid) to transform data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Kernel Trick: A mathematical technique that allows SVMs to operate in a high-dimensional space without explicitly computing the coordinates. It enables SVMs to handle non-linearly separable data efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "*2. What is the difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM ?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference between Hard Margin and Soft Margin SVM lies in how strictly the algorithm separates the classes when training the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔷 Hard Margin SVM\n",
        "Assumes that the data is perfectly linearly separable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm finds the maximum-margin hyperplane with no tolerance for misclassification.\n",
        "\n",
        "No data points are allowed inside the margin or on the wrong side of the hyperplane.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensitive to noise and outliers—even a single misclassified point can make a hard margin infeasible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use case: Clean, linearly separable datasets without outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "🔶 Soft Margin SVM\n",
        "Allows some misclassifications to achieve better generalization on real-world, noisy data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Introduces a regularization parameter (C) that controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification errors:\n",
        "\n",
        "High C → less tolerance for misclassification (closer to hard margin).\n",
        "\n",
        "Low C → more tolerance for errors, allowing a wider margin.\n",
        "\n",
        "More robust in practice and applicable to most real-world problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use case: Datasets with noise, overlap, or imperfect separability.\n",
        "\n",
        "*3. What is the mathematical intuition behind SVM ?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The mathematical intuition behind SVM revolves around finding the optimal hyperplane that best separates data points from different classes by maximizing the margin—the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest points (support vectors) from each class.\n",
        "SVMs maximize margin and use support vectors to define the decision boundary. The optimization balances margin width (simplicity) and classification error (accuracy), with extensions to non-linear problems via kernel functions\n",
        "\n",
        "*4. What is the role of Lagrange Multipliers in SVM ?*\n",
        "\n",
        "The role of Lagrange multipliers in SVM is to solve the constrained optimization problem efficiently using duality theory from convex optimization. This approach converts the original primal problem into a dual problem that's often easier to solve—especially when using kernels for non-linear SVMs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Advantages of Naïve Bayes\n",
        "1. Simple and Fast\n",
        "Training and prediction are extremely fast, especially with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time complexity is linear in the number of features and training examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Works Well with High-Dimensional Data\n",
        "Performs well even when the number of features is very large (e.g., in text classification).\n",
        "\n",
        "Often used in spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Effective with Small Data\n",
        "Requires relatively little training data to estimate model parameters (means and variances or frequencies).\n",
        "\n",
        "Performs well with limited training data, especially when the assumptions hold.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Robust to Irrelevant Features\n",
        "Even if some features are irrelevant (don’t contribute meaningfully), it can still perform well.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Handles Both Binary and Multiclass Classification\n",
        "Naturally supports multiple classes without any modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Probabilistic Output\n",
        "Provides not just a classification, but also the probability of each class, which is useful for decision-making under uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "❌ Disadvantages of Naïve Bayes\n",
        "1. Strong Independence Assumption\n",
        "Assumes conditional independence between features, which is often violated in practice.\n",
        "\n",
        "If features are highly correlated, performance may degrade.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Zero-Frequency Problem\n",
        "If a feature value is not present in the training data for a given class, the model assigns it zero probability, which can lead to incorrect classifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is usually handled with Laplace smoothing (adding 1 to all counts).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Limited Expressiveness\n",
        "Doesn’t model interactions between features (e.g., \"if feature A and B occur together\").\n",
        "\n",
        "Can underperform when decision boundaries are highly nonlinear or complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Not Good with Continuous, Non-Gaussian Data (Unless Transformed)\n",
        "Gaussian Naïve Bayes assumes that features are normally distributed. If the actual data distribution is non-Gaussian, accuracy may drop.\n",

        "May require feature scaling or transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Overconfident Probabilities\n",

        "*18. Why is Naïve Bayes a good choice for text classification ?*\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is a popular and effective choice for text classification due to several key strengths that align well with the nature of text data:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Why Naïve Bayes Works Well for Text Classification\n",
        "1. High Dimensionality Compatibility\n",
        "Text data often has thousands to millions of features (words or tokens).\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes handles this effortlessly because its computational complexity is linear with respect to the number of features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Assumption of Feature Independence is Reasonable\n",
        "In text classification, features (words) are typically modeled as independent given the document class.\n",
        "\n",
        "While words in natural language aren't truly independent, this naïve assumption surprisingly works well in practice—especially with bag-of-words or TF-IDF representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Robust to Irrelevant Features\n",
        "In text, many words (features) may be irrelevant to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is robust to noisy and irrelevant features because it evaluates each word independently, so a few noisy words don’t drastically skew predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Efficient with Sparse Data\n",
        "Text datasets are typically sparse (most word counts are zero).\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes naturally handles sparse matrices well, making it memory- and speed-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Works Well with Small Data\n",
        "Even with small training sets, Naïve Bayes can build effective models, especially when classes are well-separated by distinctive words.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Supports Multiclass Classification\n",
        "Many real-world text problems (e.g., news topic classification, intent recognition) involve multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Naïve Bayes naturally supports multiclass classification without any special modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Simple, Interpretable, and Fast\n",
        "Naïve Bayes is easy to implement, fast to train and predict, and the learned model is interpretable (you can inspect which words are most informative for each class).\n",
